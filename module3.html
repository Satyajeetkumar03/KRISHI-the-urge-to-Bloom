    <p class="sty">Agriculture is
        India’s leading sector, and it supports a significant proportion of individuals. India’s weather,
        topography, and soil have a number of desirable properties. As a consequence, the country produces a diversified
        range of crops. Rice, Wheat, and lentils are among the topmost food grains grown in India. As a consequence, the

        The Indian agriculture economy is expanding rapidly and continues to contribute to global trade. India’s grocery
        and food market is the world’s sixth-largest, representing 70% of overall sales. Food production and consumption
        patterns are transforming. In India, there has been an increase in population, income, rural/urban mobility, and
        extension of rural per capita productivity over many years. Demand for food increased as a result of the
        enhancement of all of these elements.

    <h1 style="padding-left:150px;font-weight: bold;">Types of crops : </h1>
    <p class="sty">Kharif, Ragi, and Zaid are the three major cropping seasons in India. Each season has a specific set
        of crops
        that are cultivated during that time. Here is a brief overview of the differences between these three
        cropping seasons:<br><br>
        1. Kharif crops are sown during the monsoon season, which starts in June and lasts until September. These
        crops are rain-fed, and their cultivation depends on the amount and timing of rainfall. Some of the major
        Kharif crops include rice, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, cotton, and sugarcane.

    </div>
    <p class="sty">2. Ragi, also known as Finger Millet, is a crop that is predominantly grown during the Kharif season.
        It is a rain-fed crop that is grown in areas where there is not enough water to grow rice. Ragi is a highly
        nutritious cereal crop that is rich in calcium, iron, and other minerals. It is typically used to make porridge,
        bread, and other food products.</p>
    <div class="fig">
        <img src="i12.png" width="380px" />
    </div>
    <p class="sty">3. Zaid crops are grown during the summer season, between March and June. These crops are cultivated
        in areas where there is ample water supply, and they are irrigated using wells and other sources. Some of the
        major Zaid crops include watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, bitter gourd, and pumpkin.<br><br>
        India is an agricultural country and known for its diverse agro-climatic zones. There are a variety of crops
        grown in India due to the country's diverse soil and climate conditions. The major crops grown in India include
        rice, wheat, maize, millets, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, jute, sugarcane, tea, coffee, spices, and fruits.
        Overall, agriculture is a significant contributor to India's economy and a vital source of livelihood for
        millions of people.

    <p class="sty">Let us take a look at the top Indian crops and why India is leading worldwide:</p>

    <h1 style="padding-left:150px;font-weight: bold;">RICE</h1>
    <p class="sty">Rice is India’s most popular food grain. The country is ranked second in the world for rice
        production. Rice is grown on around 34% of the country’s total cropped land. Rice cultivation accounts for 42
        percent of the country’s total food crop production. Rice is grown in India’s eastern and western coastline
        areas, Northeast India, and the Ganga’s drainage basin.</p>
    <p class="sty" style="font-weight: bold;color: black;">Major rice-growing states in India: West Bengal, Punjab &
        Uttar Pradesh</p>
    <ul class="sty">
        <li>Rice is a tropical crop that can be grown almost throughout the year.</li>
        <li>It depends on atmospheric moisture and rainfall for irrigation.</li>
        <li>India is the 2nd largest producer of rice in the world.India has the largest area in the world under rice
            cultivation.</li>
        <li>Productivity is low compared to wheat because the Green Revolution primarily boosted wheat production in
            India.</li>
        <li>The traditional rice fields are known as paddy fields and require to be flooded with 10-12 cm deep water in
            the early stages.</li>
        <li>It is critical for rice cultivation that the producing fields get an annual average of 125 cm of
            precipitation.</li>
        <li>It is also important for the average temperature of the area to remain at 23 degrees Celsius.</li>

    <h1 style="padding-left:150px;font-weight: bold;">WHEAT</h1>
    <p class="sty">Wheat is the second most significant food grain grown in India. India is the world's second-largest
        producer of wheat, producing 13.53 percent of the world's wheat, its wheat exports make up less than one percent
        of the world's total. Wheat is best grown during the Rabi season. In India, the Green Revolution set the door
        for a significant increase in wheat output. The production of the second most significant food crop has
        increased dramatically since the revolution. Better seeds, proper water utilization, and manures were all
        factors that contributed to enhanced wheat yield.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-left:150px;font-weight: bold;">COTTON</h1>
    <p class="sty">Cotton is a Kharif crop that is used in the clothing and textile industries. It takes 6-8 months for
        this Kharif crop to develop. Crops are harvested and sown at different times in different places, depending on
        the climate. It’s planted in April-May and harvested in December-January to avoid damage from winter
        frost.<br><br>
        This fibre is long, lustrous, and extremely fine. This fibre aids in the production of high-quality textiles.
        Long-staple cotton is the most widely used cotton in India, and it is also the cheapest in terms of Kapas. In
        India, long-staple cotton accounts for about half of all cotton production.

    <p class="sty">Sugarcane directly or indirectly employs over a million people while also contributing significantly
        to the national budget. Sugar cane was first discovered in New Guinea, where it has been cultivated for
        thousands of years. Sugar cane plants expanded over Asia and the Indian subcontinent as a result of human
        migration.<br><br>
        Sugarcane is one of India’s most popular crops and refers to a group of tall perennial grasses in the genus
        Saccharum, tribe Andropogoneae, that are used to make sugar. The plants are 2–6 m tall, with strong, jointed,
        fibrous stalks that collect sucrose in the stalk internodes. Weather conditions prevailing during the various
        crop-growth sub-periods have a significant impact on sugarcane productivity and juice quality.

    <h1 style="padding-left:150px;font-weight: bold;">JUTE</h1>
    <p class="sty">Jute is one of eastern India’s most important cash crops. It is a hot and humid climate crop that is
        exported as both items and raw fibre. Gunny bags, ropes, hessian, carpets, rugs, and clothing, as well as
        tarpaulins, upholstery, strings, carpets, and decorating items, are all made from jute. After cotton, jute is in
        high demand. Jute is in high demand because of its low cost, softness, strength, length, shine, and consistency.
        These excellent properties have made this fibre quite popular on the market.<br><br>
        Jute grows best in a hot, humid area with temperatures ranging from 24 to 37 degrees Celsius. However, the ideal
        temperature is around 34 degrees Celsius.

        Tea is popular in India, and you may find a nice corner with this drink in your hand anywhere from a roadside
        hut to a high-end mall. India consumes 3/4 of the total tea produced in the world. The Indian tea business is
        primarily driven by rising demand for tea due to its aroma and quality. Assam tea (highest cultivation),
        Darjeeling tea (superior grade tea), and Nilgiri tea are the three types of tea found in India (subtle and
        gentle flavors).Because of the geographical advantages, the strategic investments in equipment, and
        technological advancement, the tea produced in India is among the best globally.
