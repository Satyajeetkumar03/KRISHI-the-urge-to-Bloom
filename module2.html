        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">Cattle are
            domesticated mammals
            commonly found on farms and ranches. They are a source of milk, meat,
            and other byproducts.Cattle are an important livestock species that are commonly found on farms. They
            provide many benefits to farmers and the agriculture industry.some of the ways that cattle are helpful
            on farms:
        </p>
        <ol style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 220px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">
            <li>Meat production: Cattle are a major source of important sources of protein in many diets around the
                world.
                Farmers raise cattle for meat production, and the meat is sold to consumers through grocery stores,
                restaurants
                , and other outlets.</li>
            <li>Milk production: Dairy cattle are raised for their milk, which is used to make a variety of dairy
                products, including
                cheese, butter, and yogurt. Dairy farming is an important part of the agriculture industry, and many
                farmers rely
                on dairy cattle for their livelihood.</li>
            <li>Fertilizer: Cattle manure is a valuable source of fertilizer for crops. When cattle are raised on
                pasture, their manure helps to fertilize the soil, which can improve crop yields and reduce the need for
                synthetic fertilizers.
            </li>
            <li>Grazing: Cattle are grazers, and they can help to manage pastureland by keeping vegetation under
                control. Grazing also helps to promote healthy soil, which can benefit other crops that are grown on the
                same land.</li>
            <li>Weed control: Cattle can be used to control weeds and invasive plant species. By grazing on these
                plants, cattle can help to reduce their spread and promote the growth of more desirable vegetation.
            </li>
            <li>Income: Many farmers raise cattle as a source of income. Cattle can be sold for meat or breeding
                purposes, and their milk can be sold to dairy processors. In addition, farmers can earn income from the
                sale of other products, such as manure and hides.Overall, cattle are an important part of many farms and
                play a vital role in the agriculture industry. They provide food, fertilizer, and other benefits that
                help to sustain the farming community and support local economies.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style="padding-left: 120px;padding-right: 120px;">Cattle diseases can have a significant impact on farming,
            leading to reduced productivity, increased costs,
            and potential loss of income. Here are some ways that cattle diseases can worsen farming:</h3>
        <ol style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 220px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">
            <li>Reduced productivity: Cattle diseases can lead to reduced productivity in terms of meat and milk
                production. Sick animals may not eat or drink enough, leading to weight loss and reduced milk
                production. In some cases, infected animals may need to be culled, leading to a loss of income for the
                farmer.
            </li>
            <li>Increased costs: Treating cattle diseases can be expensive, requiring veterinary care, medications, and
                quarantine measures. Additionally, if a disease outbreak occurs, farmers may need to invest in
                biosecurity measures to prevent further spread of the disease, such as disinfecting equipment and
                facilities.</li>
            <li>Economic losses: Cattle diseases can lead to economic losses for farmers due to reduced productivity,
                increased costs, and loss of income from culled animals. In some cases, disease outbreaks can lead to
                market disruptions and reduced demand for meat and dairy products, further impacting the financial
                stability of farmers.</li>
            <li>Environmental impact: Disease outbreaks can also have environmental impacts, such as increased waste
                from culled animals and higher use of antibiotics, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance and
                environmental pollution.</li>
            <li>Risk to human health: Some cattle diseases can also pose a risk to human health. For example, bovine
                tuberculosis can be transmitted to humans through infected milk or meat, leading to health risks for
                consumers and potential economic losses for farmers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">Cattle
            diseases can have a
            significant impact on farming, leading to reduced productivity, increased costs,
            and potential loss of income. Preventative measures, such as vaccination and biosecurity practices, are
            essential to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks and protect the health and welfare of both animals and
            humans.</p>

<div class="main">
        <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;">ANTHRAX</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">Anhrax, a
            highly infectious and
            fatal disease of cattle, is caused by a relatively large spore-forming
            rectangular shaped bacterium called Bacillus anthracis.
            Anthrax causes acute mortality in ruminants. The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins which are
            responsible for the ill effects, causing a high mortality
            rate. Signs of the illness usually appear 3 to 7 days after the spores are swallowed or inhaled. Once signs
            begin in animals, they usually die within two
            days.<br><br>
            Hoofed animals, such as deer, cattle, goats, and sheep, are the main animals affected by this disease. They
            usually get the disease by swallowing anthrax
            spores while grazing on pasture contaminated (made impure) with anthrax spores. Inhaling (breathing in) the
            spores, which are odorless, colorless, and
            tasteless, may also cause infection in animals and people.</p>

        <h4>Symptoms:</h4>
        <ol style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 220px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">
            <li>Sudden death (often within 2 or 3 hours of being apparently normal) is by far the most common sign;</li>
            <li>Very occasionally some animals may show trembling, a high temperature</li>
            <li>Difficulty breathing, collapse and convulsions before death. This usually occurs over a period of 24
                hours;</li>
            <li>After death blood, may not clot, resulting in a small amount of bloody discharge from the nose, mouth
                and other openings</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Treatment and control:</h4>
        <ol style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 220px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">
            <li>Due to the acute nature of the disease resulting in sudden death, treatment is usually not possible in
                animals even though Anthrax bacilli are clines.
                Treatment is of use in cases showing sub-acute form of the disease.</li>
            <li>In most cases, early treatment can cure anthrax. The cutaneous (skin) form of anthrax can be treated
                with common antibiotics</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Preventive Measures:</h4>
        <ol style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 220px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">
            <li>Regular annual vaccination of animals in endemic areas will prevent the disease from occurring</li>
            <li>Vaccination may be carried out at least a month prior to expected disease occurrence in endemic areas
            </li>
            <li>Never open a carcass of an animal suspected to have died from anthrax.</li>
        </ol style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 220px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">

        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">It is an
            acute infectious and
            highly fatal, bacterial disease of cattle. Buffaloes, sheep and goats are also
            affected. Young cattle between 6-24 months of
            age, in good body condition are mostly affected. It is soil-borne infection which generally occurs during
            rainy season. In India, the disease is sporadic (1-2

            foot-and-mouth disease is a
            highly communicable disease affecting cloven-footed animals. It is
            characterized by fever, formation of vesicles and
            blisters in the mouth, udder, teats and on the skin between the toes and above the hoofs. Animals recovered
            from the disease present a characteristically
            rough coat and deformation of the hoof.
            In India, the disease is widespread and assumes a position of importance in livestock industry. The disease
            spreads by direct contact or indirectly through
            infected water, manure, hay and pastures. It is also conveyed by cattle attendants. It is known to spread
            through recovered animals, field rats, porcupines
            and birds.</p>

	<h4>Ethnovet prevention practice :</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">When there
            is a outbreak in the
            nearby villages /surroundings take tulasi (Ocimum sp) leaves 100 gm, a pinch
            of common salt and turmeric rhizome 2
            pieces and grind them. This has to be squeezed to obtain extract and administered orally. The residues left
            over can be used for smearing over the mouth
            region, foot region. This is repeated.</p>



        <h2 style="padding-left: 100px;">Tetanus</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">This is an
            infectious,
            non-febrile disease of animals and man, and is characterized by spasmodic tetany and
            hyperaesthesia. This disease is prevalent all
            over the world.</p>
        <h4>Transmission :</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">Infection
            takes place by
            contamination of wounds. Deep punctured wounds provide favourable conditions for the
            spores to germinate,
            multiply and produce toxin which is subsequently absorbed in the animal body. The micro-organism is present
            in soil and in animal faeces, and is carried
            into the wound by a penetrating object. The organism is present in the intestine of normal animals, and
            under some undetermined conditions multiplies
            rapidly and produces toxin in sufficient quantities to be absorbed and cause the disease.</p>

        <h4>Symptoms :</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">The
            incubation period is
            generally 1-2 weeks but it may be as short as 3 days. Tetanus affects many species
            of domesticated animals but
            occurs particularly in horses and lambs; less frequently in adult sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dog and cats;
            and rarely in poultry. The initial symptoms are mild
            stiffness and an unwillingness to move all the animals. More severe symptoms develop after 12-24 hours which
            are stiffness of limbs, neck, head, tail and
            twitching of muscles. The spasms develop in response to noise. In terminal stages ears are erect, nostrils
            dilated, nictitating membrane protruded.
            Mastication becomes very difficult because mouth cannot be opened, hence the name lockjaw.</p>
        <h4>Treatment :</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">The
            treatment is carried out by
            first injecting antitoxin then treating the wound. Penicillin parenterally is
            beneficial. Muscular relaxation is
            achieved by injection of relaxants. The animal should be kept in a dark room and fed with the help of
            stomach tube.</p>
        <h4>Control :</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">Proper
            hygiene and cleanliness
            at castration and other surgical procedures should be observed. Sheep should
            be given 2 injections based 3
            weeks apart to develop a solid immunity.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;color:grey;padding-left: 165px;padding-right: 150px;text-align: justify;">Infectious
            bovine
            rhinotracheitis (ibr) is a highly contagious, infectious respiratory disease that is caused
            by bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1). It can affect
            young and older cattle. In addition to causing respiratory disease, this virus can cause conjunctivitis,
            abortions, encephalitis, and generalised systemic
            infections. Ibr is characterized by acute inflammation of the upper respiratory tract.</p>

            antibiotics for secondary infections if necessary. Carrier cattle should be identified and removed from the
            herd.
